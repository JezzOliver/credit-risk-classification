## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of the analysis was to use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk by using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that could identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.  The aim was to accurately predict whether a loan would be healthy or high-risk.  The data was loaded from a csv file then split into trainingand testing sets.   Logical regression was performed on the data and fianlly a confusion matrix and classification report were produced.

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1: "Healthy Loans"
  * Accuracy 99% 
  * Precision 1.00 
  * Recall 0.99
* Machine Learning Model 1: "High-Risk Loans"
  * Accuracy 99% 
  * Precision 0.85 
  * Recall 0.91

## Summary

Both models did at least a good job predicting outcomes however it must be said the the abilty to correctly predict a load being healthy was clearly superior and exceptionally accurate based on the classifcation report data. 
Based on this I would certainly recomend model 1 as it is very accurate at determining if a loan was likely to be healthy or not, especially if this was the problem trying to be solved
